Introducing "Beer website": A Simple and Refreshing Beer Web Page 🍺🌐
The beer website is a passion project where I've combined my love for web development and appreciation for a good brew. 
This interactive webpage serves as a virtual companion for beer enthusiasts, providing information about various beers sourced through a free API.
Developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, Beer website offers a seamless user experience. 
The HTML structure lays the foundation, ensuring accessibility and clarity.
CSS styling enhances the visual appeal, creating a clean and inviting interface that mirrors the diverse world of beers.
The real magic happens with JavaScript, as it dynamically fetches and displays beer details from the API.
This project represents my commitment to continuous learning and creative problem-solving in web development.
