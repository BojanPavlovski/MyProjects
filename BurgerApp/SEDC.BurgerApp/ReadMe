Introducing "Burger App": A .NET MVC Gastronomic Delight with N-Tier Architecture üçîüñ•Ô∏è
This burger app is a savory web application meticulously crafted with .NET MVC, exemplifying the finesse of N-Tier architecture. 
This culinary hub seamlessly integrates with a local SQL database, ensuring robust data management. 
I have also implemented the pages functionalities using an in-memory list that holds the data, making it easier
for anyone viewing this project to see and test its CRUD functionalities,offering users a swift and responsive experience.
The implementations can be easily switched because of the implementation of dependency injection.
The heart of this project lies in its sophisticated N-Tier architecture, dividing the application into distinct layers for presentation, 
business logic, and data access.
The .NET MVC framework orchestrates the flawless interaction between the user interface and the SQL database, 
while the N-Tier architecture ensures a structured and efficient codebase.
